There is no need for a design for this homework assignment since I'm more or less asking you to put together a set of statements! 


Include a Script or a Simple API into your website. This assignment is meant to be a precursor to your final assignment to get you thinking about Assignment #5 - which is the pitch for your Final Project. 

The Final Project is all about interactivity.   Please use the handout called "homework.js" and add the following: 

1.  It greets the user with their name (1pt) (hint: use ALERT to get their name) 
2.  Shows their location  (1pt)  https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_geolocation.aspLinks to an external site.  and show a local time based on location 
4. When the user presses a button, have it change images (hint: use practical example for inspiration) 
5. Make a small calculator (hint: see the practical!) 

 

If you've followed along the lecture, we have already set up the HTML for this. We just need to update the Javascript.
