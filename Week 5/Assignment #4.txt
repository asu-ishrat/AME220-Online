Include a Script or a Simple API into your website. This assignment is meant to be a precursor to your final assignment to get you thinking about Assignment #5 - which is the pitch for your Final Project. 

The Final Project is all about interactivity.   Please use the handout called "homework.js" and add the following: 

1.  It greets the user with their name (1pt) (hint: use PROMPT to get their name) 
2. When a user presses a button, it will call a function to show a location 
3.  Shows their location: https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_geolocation.aspLinks to an external site.  and show a local time based on location 
4.  update the HTML for this. 

 

If you've followed along the lecture, we have already set up the HTML for this. We just need to update the Javascript.
